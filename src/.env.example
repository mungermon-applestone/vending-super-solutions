# Contentful Configuration
# The Space ID and Environment ID are public and can use the VITE_ prefix
VITE_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id_here
VITE_CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT_ID=master

# The Delivery Token can be added either way:

# Option 1 (PREFERRED): Without VITE_ prefix to keep it server-side only
# This is more secure but requires proper server environment configuration
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=your_delivery_token_here

# Option 2: With VITE_ prefix for client-side access
# This will expose the token in the browser (less secure)
VITE_CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=your_delivery_token_here

# IMPORTANT: Only use one of the above token options, not both
# For Lovable environments, you'll likely need to use the VITE_ version
