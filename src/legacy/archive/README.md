This folder contains deprecated code that has been archived as part of our migration
from legacy CMS implementations to Contentful.

These files are kept temporarily for reference purposes only and will be completely
removed in a future release.

- Phase 1: Initial deprecation (completed)
- Phase 2: Admin interface updates (completed)
- Phase 3: Progressive removal (in progress)
- Phase 4: Schema cleanup (planned)
- Phase 5: Final validation and documentation (planned)

## What's Archived Here

- Machine migration utilities (moved from `/src/utils/machineMigration`)
