# CMS Migration Guide: From Legacy to Contentful

## Overview

This document outlines the migration strategy from legacy CMS implementations (Strapi, direct DB) to Contentful. It provides guidance for developers working with the codebase during this transition period.

## Current Status

As of May 2025, we have completed the following migration steps:

1. ‚úÖ Implementation of Contentful adapters for all content types
2. ‚úÖ Deprecation of non-Contentful adapters
3. ‚úÖ Addition of compatibility layers for legacy code
4. ‚úÖ Implementation of deprecation tracking system
5. ‚úÖ Creation of adapter compatibility layer to bridge different method naming conventions
6. üîÑ Conversion of admin interfaces to read-only views
7. üîÑ Removal of mock database operations
8. ‚è≥ Complete removal of compatibility layers

## Timeline

- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ Implement Contentful adapters (Completed January 2025)
- **Phase 2:** ‚úÖ Deprecate non-Contentful adapters (Completed March 2025)
- **Phase 3:** ‚úÖ Provide compatibility layers & method name bridging (Completed May 2025)
- **Phase 4:** üîÑ Convert interfaces to read-only (In progress - May 2025)
- **Phase 5:** ‚è≥ Remove compatibility layers and legacy code (Scheduled for July 2025)

## For Developers

### Using the New System

All content management should now be done directly in Contentful. The application code should:

1. Import adapters directly from their specific modules:
   ```typescript
   // Correct approach
   import { contentfulProductAdapter } from '@/services/cms/adapters/products/contentfulProductAdapter';
   
   // Deprecated approach - do not use
   import { getProductAdapter } from '@/services/cms/adapters/products/productAdapterFactory';
   ```

2. Use Contentful content type IDs:
   | Entity | Content Type ID | Description |
   |--------|----------------|-------------|
   | Product | `product` | Products offered |
   | Machine | `machine` | Physical machines |  
   | Technology | `technology` | Technology platform |
   | Business Goal | `businessGoal` | Business goals |
   | Case Study | `caseStudy` | Customer success stories |

3. Reference environment variables from the Contentful configuration:
   ```typescript
   import { getContentfulConfig } from '@/services/cms/utils/contentfulConfig';
   
   const { spaceId, accessToken } = getContentfulConfig();
   ```

### Method Name Compatibility

We've added a compatibility layer to bridge different method naming conventions:

```typescript
// BusinessGoalAdapter uses getAll, getBySlug, getById methods
// ContentTypeOperations uses fetchAll, fetchBySlug, fetchById methods

// This compatibility layer creates a unified interface
const compatibleAdapter = makeContentTypeOperationsCompatible(
  businessGoalAdapter,
  'businessGoal'
);

// Now compatibleAdapter has both sets of methods:
// - Original methods: getAll, getBySlug, getById 
// - Compatibility methods: fetchAll, fetchBySlug, fetchById
```

### Working with Deprecated Types

All legacy types have been moved to compatibility layers and should not be used in new code:

1. Machine Types:
   - Old import (deprecated): `@/utils/machineMigration/types`
   - New recommended import: `@/types/cms`

2. Business Goal Types:
   - Old import (deprecated): Various legacy locations
   - New recommended import: `@/types/cms`

3. Product Types:
   - Old import (deprecated): Various adapter-specific interfaces
   - New recommended import: `@/types/cms`

### Admin Interface

All admin interfaces are now read-only views with clear redirects to Contentful:

1. Product editing is now done in Contentful directly
2. Business Goal management is now done in Contentful directly
3. Technology content management is now done in Contentful directly

### Identifying Deprecated Code

All deprecated code includes:

1. Clear `@deprecated` JSDoc annotations
2. Runtime deprecation warnings via `logDeprecationWarning()`
3. Usage tracking via our deprecation monitoring system

You can view usage statistics of deprecated features in the admin dashboard.

## Removal Schedule

The following components and modules are scheduled for complete removal:

| Component/Module | Removal Date |
|------------------|--------------|
| Strapi configuration | July 2025 |
| Supabase direct database operations | July 2025 |
| Legacy admin interfaces | August 2025 |
| Compatibility types | August 2025 |
| Deprecation tracking system | September 2025 |
